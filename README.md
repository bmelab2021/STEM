## Required libraries:  

## Steps:  
1.Preprocess the video data  
2.Use the temporal_model.py to train the temporal stream model and get the output of the model  
3.Use the spatial_model.py to train the spatial stream model and get the output of the model  
4.Use the get_weight_value.m and ensemble_weight.m to get the output prediction value of the spatial and temporal stream model by their weight.
